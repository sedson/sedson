Hi, I'm Seamus. 

I am a computer-artist-turned-programmer building playful tools with web technologies. I recently finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

#### Right now I'm
- working on [Slop](https://github.com/sedson/slop), an in-browser Lisp environment for creative coding and image editing
- fiddling with smaller ideas in the [lab](https://github.com/sedson/lab)
